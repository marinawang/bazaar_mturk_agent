I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to   take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive   word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS    netters will be amiable in their explanation.)  Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say  no good  because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not  the authors of the Creed were inspired)  I leave you (it will be some time  before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England   Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the  following as part of a book review section in This People s magazine (Spring  1993 edition):     I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--   or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other    with terms like feminist or patriarchal  liberal or conservative (Christian    or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around   a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American  then exclude   those who don t fit  it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central   defining characteristic of a good American might be  one who doesn t draw   exclusive circles  -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the    central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to   draw a circle around  Mormon  or  Christian   to decide who is  orthodox    and who isn t by how much they agree with us  it might be well to consider   that the central pillar of Christ s  orthodoxy  is our ability to love   unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.     I recently spent some time in a  Christian  bookstore in California. The   service was excellent  the clerks and customers all smiling  neat  and   well-scrubbed  and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural   commentaries  sentimental fiction  and collections of evangelistic sermons.   But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking    others  often viciously---whether the political left  our modern American   culture  or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to  Cults and the   Occult   and as you might expect  Mormonism was right there under the same   rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found   I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers   (that absurdly inaccurate  even libelous  but very popular and dangerous   anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations   of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).     It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to   Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety ( Perfect   love casteth out fear   I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the   LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths  though I find a    disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the   same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive   action---as the  religious right wing  has launched this year against the   political left and American cultural and religious styles they don t like.   It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the   very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would    if they had power  forcefully restrict Mormons  rights along with those of   others they believe to be evil.    The above  sermon  was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe to This People s magazine  but would certainly apply to all of us who rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His arms.    Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles  of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ  the Church does not claim  perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do  now lead the Church.  I  for one  do not wish to be labelled  Christian   if  those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are  intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical  scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication  than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again  being in the  majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective  voice is louder.  That s really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter  the LDS Church  interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths  and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to  disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone  least of all themselves.

However  since I m not adverse to learning the internals of Windows programming  the new programming methodology should be closely aligned with the native one.  I don t believe arbitrary levels of abstraction  just for the sake of changing the API  are valuable.    Since we will be developing for the 32bit Windows NT system the memory management issues and issues particular to the Windows 3.1 API are less important.     We will probably buy another C++ class library (something like Tools.h++ or Booch components from Rational) to handle data structures and other miscellaneous stuff  (allocators etc...).  So those features are not that important for this toolkit to have.  The two that I have narrowed it down to are ZApp and Zinc  they seem to be the two toolkits that have received the most attention from the media.  I was wondering if anyone had any first-hand experience with any of these toolkits (especially ZApp and Zinc).  A couple of observations about these toolkits that seem particularly noteworthy are:  ZApp ----   Seems to have the most extensive coverage of Windows functionality and     also includes some other miscellaneous useful classes.   Has new fancy 3D-style controls available  and support for custom controls.   Has a Windows NT version (Essential)   Redirectable graphics display/output architecture (useful for printing)   Sizer class for automatically managing control layout after resize.

With the flames go the prayers of about 1 200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that their faith will survive this land.      There is a fear - a real fear  too   said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette.  We have one generation to do it or to die.      Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land. But for Zoroastrians  it is an especially poignant concern.     Their religion has been around for perhaps 3 700 years  a heritage so deep it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where  historical sites  are sometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ was born about 500 years later  he was honored by a visit from three Zoroastrian priests  the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians  Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster  the Zoroastrian prophet.     Yet  with only about 150 000 Zoroastrians in the entire world  they are  a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a people is very much on their minds.     Ironically  local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed by nearly 1 000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion  and they actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children become totally assimilated  they say  it s their children - rather than the world at large - who will be the losers.      It s important to have an identity   said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose  a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.   It s important for everybody - Irish  Scottish  Americans.  It gives meaning to life. You don t have to depend on the majority community to give you respect. You can fall back on your own identity.      For Zoroastrians  there s much to be proud of.     Their prophet  Zoroaster  seeking to make sense of a culture in which animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common  preached that there was only one god  a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda  which translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.  _Good vs. evil_     Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil  with the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for good  he said  and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty  charity  kindness to animals  respect for the environment  hard work  equality of men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.     But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact  Joseph Campbell  the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths  traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.     Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto  leaded into a stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of Mount Hamilton  is  Good thoughts  good words  good deeds.      So it s not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India  where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape persecution by Muslims in Iran  Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy  the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.     About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India and Pakistan  mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state where others had no rights.     Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on  good deeds  has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose  the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because Manou Mobedshahi  a San Francisco-based hotelier  passed the boarded-up downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple s dedication  the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta  the Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.     The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an Iranian emigre  the late Arbab Rustom Guiv  to buy land for six temples in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount Hamilton  he paid for land in Los Angeles  Chicago  New York  Toronto  and Vancouver.  Until his gifts  there were no Zoroastrian temples on this continent.     Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple  and the property already had a large house that they have converted to a community center.     The temple  dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet  Zoroaster  is a simple structure with gleaming white walls  vaulted  ceilings and oak floors  partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.     Its central feature is the fire  set in the middle of a partly-glassed- in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are  sometimes called  fire worshippers   they actually consider fire just  a symbol of God.   It helps us concentrate  just like Christians use the  cross and Muslims use the Holy Book   Bhujwala said.     The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all Iranians  including Zoroastrians  the New Year begins on the first day of the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With Zoroaster s birthday just six days later  the combination of religious and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.    For this year s celebration of the prophet s birthday  about 500 people came to worship and revel.      The good things in life are not forbidden   Esfandiar Anoushiravani  a leader of the Iranian members  had said beforehand  and what followed proved him right.     Inside the temple  worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking sandalwood  glasses of milk and water  and a tray heaped with dried fruit and nuts.     Kids crowded around  grabbing handfuls of the treats.   People eat the fruit   Tarapore said.   It s a way to participate in the ceremony.   _Santa Claus  sort of_     The gathering even had a Santa Claus  Iranian style.  With flowing white hair and a bag of gifts for the children  this Amownaroz wore green symbolic of spring) and red.     He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown  Hajefyrouz  who danced and played a tambourine.     The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.   This is all new for us  too   one told a visitor who asked what was going on.     A visitor  John A. Sabanovich of Folsom  said he became intrigued with the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have no procedure for accepting converts - a result  some say  of their centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his people s religion.     But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the San Jose temple whenever he can.      When I first heard about this religion   he said   I thought  my God  this is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.      People who don t have a tradition  something to lean on  what s the difference with the lower animals?   ------------------------------------------------ end of article ---- windows,  ===Martinreligion,  >                                       If I recall correctly there >are protist cells that can divide and multiply quite readily without >nuclear DNA.

It has been reported previously and there is a fix.  Apparantly the problem only occurs when TAB characters are used immediately preceding the equation frame.  The work around when equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one preceding TAB and use SPACE to align the frame (or use set frame where placed w/no text wrap around).  Unforutnately  once the page run-on has occured you are hosed. So the moral of the story is use only SPACE characters to align equation frames.

What justification do you have for this?  No  Mathew is proposing a public defence mechanism  not treating the electronic device as an impropriety on the wearer. What he is saying is that the next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potential criminals.  This may not  on the surface  sound like a bad thing  but who defines what a potential criminal is? If the government of the day decides that being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminal then openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice  this is not conducive to a free society.  Mathew is saying that implanting electronic surveillance devices upon people is an impropriety upon that person  regardless of what type of crime or what chance of recidivism there is. Basically you see the criminal justice system as a punishment for the offender and possibly  therefore  a deterrant to future offenders. Mathew sees it  most probably  as a means of rehabilitation for the offender. So he was being cynical at you  okay?

Man knows in his heart that there is right and wrong.  We have >all inherited this knowledge.    No matter how  absurd  it is to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is absolute  it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common moral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact  for the Bible to be of any use to mankind as a moral code  it must be interpreted by mankind and a workable moral system created for everyday use.  The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of Israel were given a very strict set of Moral  Civil  Judicial and Ceremonial Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian  the situation is no better.  It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo- Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was written down by man.  This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many different ways (as an example  consider the immolation of heretics in the fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively  we could take the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers have done).  Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society  I think the important aspect is the result.

The typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the same inherent motivation  so one is not  intrinsically  different from the other  qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn somewhere  and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core  than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery  ie  how it expresses its own selfishness.

But I can t guarantee that I m not way off base...  The permenant swap file is read/written to by windows by talking directly to the hard disk controller card.  The controller card must use the protocal set up by western digital (or something like that). Windows creates a file called spart.par in your windows directory that points to that file.  It then uses the physical information about your disk to index to information in that file.  compressed disks are actually  logical  disks.  These disks have different characteristics than the actual physical disk.  Furthermore  the information on the compressed disks must be uncompressed before it is used.  (i.e it must go through the decompression program that traps disk reads at the operating system level or the BIOS level).  Because of this  inbetween  program  windows cannot use direct methods to read from the  logical  disk.  a permenant swap file is only there to  reserve  an area of the disk that windows can use and to block that space from DOS.  Windows would theoretically not even have to access the file from DOS to use that disk space. (I don t know if it does or doesn t...but it checks for it somewhere everytime you boot windows.)  a temporary swap file is just a normal DOS file that is accessed by windows via DOS and the BIOS.  If a disk compression program or other TSR is loaded the file access must go through DOS...TSR S (disk compression)...and BIOS in order to be access. (i.e. NEVER USE A TEMPORARY SWAP FILE...NEVER)  more on permenent swap files...  i m sure everyone who has an uncompressed part of their compressed hard disk has seen the message  you have selected a swap file greater than the suggested size...windows will only use the size suggested...do you wan t to create this swap file anyway  or something like that.  well  a friend of mine (ROBERT) called microsoft and asked them what and why. what they said is that windows checks the amount of free disk space and divides that number by 2.  Then it checks for the largest contiguous block of free disk space.  Windows then suggests the smaller of the two numbers.  They also said that under absolutely no circumstances...NONE!...will windows uses a swap file larger than the suggested size.  Well...that s what he  said!  I call bull@ $ .  If this is true why does windows report the memory is available to me if it s not going to use it?  any takers?

Your definition of the word  morality  is what is causing you to trip over  yourself here.     /(me) /And since />I  selfish being that I am  want to maximize my gains from society  I will />not do anything to another member of society if that action might cut down />on how much benefit I can derive from society.  /(hudson) /Why is your benefit somehow related to morality.  Again  your definition is causing you to shoot yourself in the foot.      /(hudson) /What about if someone feels that their own personal benefit is enhanced /more than it would be damaged by depleting the overall resources of society? /Maybe something might hurt society  but it would help him immensly?  That is irrational thinking.    There may also be people out there who think that death by atomic  destruction is  a sublime and wonderful thing. I am not going to let them execute that idea just because they want to do it.   Simply because I let people make up their minds about what morals they have doesn t prevent me from spotting and stopping a madman when I see one  Hudson.  And even then  I will only stop him when he interferes  with me and my life.  That is the difference between me and you:  you want to interfere in people s lives even when they aren t affecting you.        /(hudson) /The central character in Dostoevsky s novel  Crime and Punishment   /(R something or other) reasoned that if killed this old Jewish woman and /stole her money to educate and establish himself financially  he could /make a great contribution to society.  He reasoned that she was not of  /much profit to society.  She just collected rents  and hoarded money.   One of the central points of any (that s ANY) moral system is that is has to be internally consistent.    By killing her  the character had to accept the premise that the ends justify the means.  If he accepted that premise  then (in order to be consistent)  he must accept the idea that some day another person may apply the same standard to HIS life.  Now  if he is unwilling to accept this premise (which he will not be willing to accept)  then he has behaved inconsistently with his own moral standard.      /(me) /[football example deleted]  /(hudson) /Now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the /players in the field/on the court is injured (or killed.)

The internal consistency question is also not addressed:  if the freshman wants to do this to other people  then he has to accept the fact that it may happen to him one day.

I appreciate : the help.  Thanks.  Yes - ignore the manual.  Just insert the evelope - don t use the keypad to move it up.  The Windows driver sends a message to the printer that tells it to load the envelope - if it is already loaded  it gets ejected and the printer tries to load another.

Americans have become so insensitive to the needs of others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious moral decisions based on reality.  If a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own  he is not considered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has fled his responsibility  has behaved like a lazy coward  and has turned away from his responsibility to his wife and child.  However  if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden  she is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons  the woman suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life. When the woman abandons  the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed out  and the man has no choice  and the man sometimes suffers so badly that he wishes he could trade places with his child.  Ths root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says   My feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.  And when you come down to it  this is the substance of what hell is made of. It s the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his demons for all of eternity.

As it is now  we don t see our responsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media backs us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only  responsibility  that sells in the marketplace is that which is just enough to make us  feel responsible  without showing anything that might show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to  feel  like good people  but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just give me the freedom to say  I m good   and the rest of the world can burn. Rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where poor old folks rot until they re dead.  I ll hate my brother and sister if I wish and I ll cheat on my wife or husband.  Screw the government  because it screws me  and don t talk to me about giving to the church because church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites. But  I m a good person.  At least I admit what I do.  At least I love myself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not that a man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too  christian .  At the root  this is the substance of what hell is made of.

If the code was once perfect  and has degraded ever since  we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement  shouldn t we?  Perhaps the biggest  imperfection  of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions  introns  which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin  it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains.  Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur  and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.   On the other hand  the possibility that introns have been inserted later  presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present  but unused  if introns are inserted. Moreover  intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated  since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides  transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications  and these are not found in or near intron sequences.   I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting  theological arguments  like this.  Try Watson s Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell  Lodish & Baltimore s Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.  : Remember  the question was posed in a theological context (Why does : God cause disease in newborns?)  and my answer is likewise from a : theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely : scientific perspective  just different.  Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence  whereas  theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.   : I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect  : but that doesn t mean it s perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.  For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective  unless you support it by some evidence.  In fact  it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we ve thought - for instance  sex might have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution  eg Tierra.)    : Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays  gamma : rays  and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.  In fact  it is thermal energy that does most of the damage  although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action.   : Actually  neither of us  knows  what the atmosphere was like at the : time when God created life.  According to my recollection  most : biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after : all  that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth : was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I : seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for : the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?  I d replace  created  with  formed   since there is no need to  invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one. Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years  and earliest signs of life (not true fossils  but organic  stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years. This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve.

I hope you don t forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests  everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against this conclusion? In science  one does not have to _believe_ in  anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the  right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so  and not to present one s own conclusions prior to this.   Theology does not use this method. Therefore  I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions.  : >>Human DNA  being more  complex   tends to accumulate errors adversely : >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease  while the  : >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  : >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence : >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic  viral  and bacterial : >>diseases/disorders.  You are supposing a purpose  not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to  survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn t make it  to the present.   And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection  and thus are bound to degrade. I haven t seen much evidence for either claim.   : But then I ask  So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in : answering John s question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases  : and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require : babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God s fault? (the original : question) -- I say no  it is not.  Of course  nothing  evil  is god s fault.  But your explanation does not work  it fails miserably.   : You may be right.  But the fact is that you don t know that : Satan is not responsible  and neither do I. :  : Suppose that a powerful  evil being like Satan exists.  Would it : be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills : that affect mankind?  I don t think so.  He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is  it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases  they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution.  : Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference. : Actually what you ve done is to oversimplify what I said to the : point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I : never said that people are  meant  (presumably by God)  to be : punished by getting diseases .  Why I did say is that free moral : choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject : God  as people have done since the beginning  then they should not : expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic : universe.  I am not expecting this. If god exists  I expect him to leave us alone. I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free. This is an interesting philosophical question  and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.  What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?    : Oh  I admit it s not perfect (yet).  But I m working on it.  :)  A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.  : What does this have to do with the price of tea in China  or the : question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are : fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain : *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don t explain : the why behind creation  life  or its subsequent evolution.  Why is there a  why behind ? And your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend these books.  Is there any need to invoke any why behind  a prime mover? Evidence for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention  as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al) suggest  why do people still insist on this?   : Thanks Scotty  for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am : not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details : of biology and genetics  although I m sure I d find it a : fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do : not change the Big Picture  that God created life in the : beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its : environment.  I m sorry  but they do.

It isn t so much a matter of  interpretation  of Bible texts  that sets Mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of  *fabrication*.  	About 20 years ago  _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips  in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called  Son o  God  comics.  It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic  there were a  group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn  and when one of them said  the magic word  he turned into  Son o  God.  He went from a myopic   curly headed  yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied  portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile  features.	  	Now  if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus   and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this  NatLamp Jesus  we would have to say that this was fallacious since  this Jesus was a fabrication  and did not really exist.  	This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim  that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus  but the Jesus  that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the  NatLamp Jesus was.   ============================= Robert Weiss psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu"windows," `In article <1993Apr06.023730.5094@microsoft.com> davidgl@microsoft.com (David Glenn) writes:  	...

Now  when I buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs  I ll specify that I only pick up the normal UPS charges (as if delivered directly to UPS)  as I ve been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2.49 pkg.

Other things to watch out for/consider:  	The rates are $5 to $30 higher than UPS direct.  	For a non-UPS (truck) package  they quoted a rate 	of $85. Fed Ex economy air was only $85 for the 	same weight! RPS (a trucking package company  in many 	cities) only wanted $18. Guess who got it. The Mailbox 	operator told me I was not telling the truth about 	competitors  rates  said RPS was unreliable (I ve used them 	before with NO problems)  etc. Right.  	A COD check goes to the mailing service. Our local 	Mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the 	remade check. All this for an additional $3.00 over the 	UPS COD charge. What a deal.... :-)  	For packages over $100  they charge you about double over 	what UPS charges them for insurance. I ve never had 	a claim  but other netters (is Ralph Seguin out there?) 	have told horror stories about them...  	All package traces have to be done through Mailbox by 	Mailbox.  	Our local Mailbox operator told me I was lying when I 	asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared 	to direct UPS. Does he ever check? Probably not...  	Their UPS ground rates come close to Fed Ex s economy 	air rate  and Fed Ex will pick up!  	UPS will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas! 	 --  --------------------------------------------------------------------        Dave Medin			Phone:	(205) 730-3169 (w)     SSD--Networking				(205) 837-1174 (h)     Intergraph Corp.

Thus while I believe that no gods exist  this does                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > not imply *faith* on my part that it is so.   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Let me first say that  to believe that no gods exist  is in fact  different than  not believing in a god or gods .   I will argue that your latter statement   I believe that no gods exist  does rest upon faith - that is  if you are making a POSITIVE statement  that  no gods exist  (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don t   know and therefore don t believe in them and don t NOT believe in then (weak atheism). Once again  to not believe in God is different than saying   I BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position  even  after reading the FAQs  that strong atheism requires faith.  But first let me say the following. We might have a language problem here - in regards to  faith  and  existence . I  as a Christian  maintain that God does not exist. To exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE being - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist  He is eternal. With this said  I feel it s rather pointless to debate the so called  existence  of God - and that is not what I m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of being. When you say that  god does not exist   I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However  in what follows I will use the phrase  the existence of God  in it s  usual sense  - and this is the sense that I think you are using it. I would like a clarification upon what you mean by  the existence of God .   We also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what Webster says:  faith  1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY b  (1): fidelity to one s promises    (2): sincerity of intentions 2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God    (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    (2): complete trust 3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction  esp: a system     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF    One can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say that you believe God does not exist  and that this is an opinion  based upon observation   I will have to ask  what observtions are you refering to?  There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to (by predisposed I mean  for example  people whoes  partents  believe in God  also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion about the  existence  or  non-existence  of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say  I believe that God   does/does not exist . Personally  I think that both statements are misguided. Arguing over the  existence  of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him (and yes  I use  Him  because a personal God is the only  viable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use  She  go ahead. Of course  God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to  anthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I ll be  glad to.)     And please  if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently  disagree - it s in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person  thinks I ve misunderstood something in the FAQs  or if they they think  I have not read them well enough  just point out to me the error of my  ways and I correct the situation. I m interested in a polite and well   thought out discussion.         > Cheers >  > Simon > --  > Simon Clippingdale                simon@dcs.warwick.ac.uk > Department of Computer Science    Tel (+44) 203 523296 > University of Warwick             FAX (+44) 203 525714 > Coventry CV4 7AL  U.K.  -- bob singleton bobs@thnext.mit.eduwindows, >  > : I ve just bought a PC which came with a bundle of Lotus stuff  including > : Adobe Type Manager version 1.15.

Both Type 1 and TT fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality at any size. It all depends on the font s maker and the complexity of the glyphs related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. Probably the reason for your opinion/experience that TT is inferior is because most TT fonts on the market today have been converted from Type 1 outlines to TT either by the font vendor or end-users using Fontographer or FontMonger instead of the TT fonts being hand-hinted to take advantage of the TT hinting language. At best these converted TT fonts will be on a par with the Type 1 font of its orgin.  TrueType is a much richer and more robust hinting language than Type 1 (the hinting of diagonals for instance  which TT does and Type 1 cannot). If you check out the Windows 3.1 core fonts (Times  Arial  Courier  Symbol  Wingdings) you ll see what can be done with TT. There are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not just converted. Some of the Microsoft TT Font Pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.  > You can use both TT and ATM fonts at the same time  if you like. > ATM (Type 1) fonts tend to be of higher quality > and be more complete in terms of foreign characters.  Again  not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they ll only get the characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on. For instance  all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.   > Regards                                             1001-A East Harmony Road > Bob Niland                                          Suite 503 > Internet:  rjn@csn.org                              Fort Collins CO 80525 > CompuServe: 71044 2124                              (303) 223-5209  Hope this clears up some of the confusion.

It is its own OS  with (Billy Gates assures us) true  multi-tasking/multithreading  meets DOD security specs  will run win3.1  programs as well as DOS programs  has multi-processor support  and is primarily a Server program.  It s overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users. 	Speaking of overhead  it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.   It iwll run with 12  but that s like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.  And that s  just to run it.  Also  I have heard that the system files take up 30-50 Megs   and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig!  The SKD is distributed  on CD-ROM.  Chicogo is what I want to use.  It is  like NT  a true OS with thrue  multitasking and multithreading  but has much smaller hardware requirements   and does not meet DOD security specs (but that s okay since it will probably  be more of a client OS).  there are a few otehr differences  but those are the  main ones.  There was an article about Chicogo in PC Week last August. 	The Chicogo and NT development groups at Micro$oft are in intense  competition  so it is said.  However  I think a different relationship will  arise: NT will be the server (*N*etowrk *T*echonology)  Chicogo will be the  client machine.  It is entirely possible for different OS s to work together   partly because Chicogo is just a small NT (think of it that way  anyway).

Unfortunately your phrasing is ambiguous.  Re-writing more carefully  we have (at least) two possibilities.  The first:  Things called  Mercedes  are cars That girl is called  Mercedes  Therefore that girl is a car  That is entirely valid as a piece of logical deduction.  It is not sound  because the first statement is false.  Similarly  I would hold that Jim s example is valid but not sound.  Another possible interpretation of what you wrote is:  There exists at least one car called  Mercedes  That girl is called  Mercedes  Therefore that girl is a car  -- which isn t valid.   mathewreligion, > >    Not to be too snide about it  but I think this Christianity must > >    be a very convenient religion  very maliable and suitable for > >    any occassion since it seems one can take it any way one wants > >    to go with it and follow whichever bits one pleases and > >    reinterpret the bits that don t match with one s desires.

This is not  strickly correct. Only by incorrect application of the  rules of language  does it seem to work.  	The Mercedes in the first premis  and the one in the second are NOT  the same Mercedes.   	In your case    	A = B 	C = D 	 	A and D are NOT equal. One is a name of a person  the other the name of a object. You can not simply extract a word without taking the  context into account.   	Of course  your case doesn t imply that A = D.  	In his case  A does equal D.   	Try again...  ---           One thing that relates is among Navy men that get tatoos that          say  Mom   because of the love of their mom.

I think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space limit with the virtual address space limit.  As far as the disk is concerned  you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space. The limit that causes the message   Windows will only use ...   is the amount of virtual address space that the Virtual Memory Manager will create  and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have when Windows starts.  In the [386enh] section of SYSTEM.INI  you can specify a parameter:  	PageOverCommit=multiplier  The following description is from the Windows Resource Kit:  	This entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of 	linear address space the VMM will create for the system  which is 	computed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to 	the nearest 4 MB and then multiplying that value by the value 	specified for PageOverCommit=.  Increasing this value increases the 	amount of available linear address space  causing the size of data 	structures to increase.  This also increases paging activity 	proportionately and can slow down the system.  You can specify a 	value between 1 and 20.  The default is 4.  To change this entry  	you must edit SYSTEM.INI.  -- Bob Nichols AT&T Bell Laboratories rnichols@ihlpm.ih.att.com"atheism, > >In article <114127@bu.edu>  jaeger@buphy.bu.edu (Gregg Jaeger) writes: >|>  >|> I don t understand the point of this petty sarcasm.

Of course B.M. is not incorrect.  He is defending Islam.  When defending Islam against infidels you can say anything and no one will dare criticize you.  But when an atheist uses the same argument he is using  petty sarcasm .  So B.M. can have his  temporary atheists  whenever he needs them and all the  temporary atheists  can later say that they were always good Muslims because they never explicitly rejected Islam.    Temporary atheism  temporary Islam  temporary marriage.  None of it sticks.   A teflon religion.  How convenient.  And so easy to clean up after.

If this is true why does windows report the memory is >available to me if it s not going to use it? > >any takers? > >James  Well  someone at Microsoft told you wrong.  Windows will use a swap file larger than the recommended size.  Last summer I went to a Microsoft Windows 3.1 Technical Workshop and they distributed A LOT of information that the general public might not be aware of.  Anyway in the main book they handed out they have a section on  Creating larger than recommended swapfile .  I ll quote the information    If you create a permanent swapfile larger than the recommended size  you   will receive a message telling you that Windows will not use anything   larger than the recommended size.  THIS ERROR MESSAGE IS INCORRECT  we   will allow the use of the larger swapfile  up to four times the amount   of RAM on your machine.  So as you see  Microsoft does know that the information is incorrect.  You probably just ran into some doofball who was new on the job and was only telling you what little he knew.  Be that what it may  I would really suggest to everyone to take the opportunity to go to these Technical Workshops.  They aren t actually incredibly in-depth  but you do get a lot of material about bugs and optimization straight from those in the know.  Besides that they offer you HUGE discounts on software.  If I remember correctly  you could pick up Word 2.0  Excel 4.0  or whatever their presentation program is for $130. That is the full blown version  not an upgrade or educational version.  You could also pick up Microsoft Office for $500 or something like that.  Myself I sprang for Word.  Well  hope that was helpful to someone.  And besides that I hope someone will go to a workshop and save a little money.  And if anyone at Microsoft is reading this -- I really love your products. I need a job once I graduate also  can we work something out?   -)  Thanks  Brent Casavant bcasavan@mailhost.ecn.uoknor.edu religion, > >SU>>     When one person is the cause of another s heart to stop beating  >SU>>     that one has committed murder. >   So kill a cow  you re a murderer?  -jim halat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    atheism, > >Yes. >   Define perfect then.     >> I think you >> are playing the usual game here  make sweeping statements like omni-  >> holy  or perfect  and don t note that they mean exactly what they say. >> And that says that you must not use this terms when it leads to >> contradictions. > >I m not trying to play games here.

Like I said  I am not sure >that doing  not good  without doing evil is logically possible.   And when I am not omnipotent  how can I have free will? You have said something about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have what you define as free will.   Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings  but I cannot harm them. Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds  but don t make them long for them  so they can not feel the absence of good as evil.   But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable  so the omnipotent can do it. Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well  you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.

It is   > however  highly probable.                   ^^^^^^  and   > Also  there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply > means  hang oneself .  Actually  if you do further research as to the Greek word  apacgw   you will find that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent reason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out  I recently checked several Lexicons:  	 Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament   Louw and Nida 	 Robinson s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament  	 Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament   Grimm 	 Word study Concordance   Tynsdale 	 A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other  	 early Christian Writings   Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich 	 The New Analytical Greek Lexicon   Perschbacher  A couple simply stated  hanged oneself   and a couple were more explicit  and stated that  apacgw  means specifically  kill yourself by hanging.  A couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for  apacgw  is  strangle  throttle or choke  (which pretty much invalidates the guy who suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best references though   Robinson s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament   not only stated the translation  it gave both the root words  the literal translation  related greek words which use the same roots  and also other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give further context).    The word  apagchw  has two root words:  gchw  is the  to strangle  root  and the root word  apo  means literally  away.  This root words is included in words which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the greek word  apagello  means to send a message).   Apo  can also denote a change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson specifically makes comparison to the word  apokteiuo   which means  to kill.  In literal meaning the word  apacgw  means  to throttle  strangle to put out of the way   and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from life  to death).  So while the word  apacgw  does mean  to hang   it specifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he state that it means  to hang oneself  to end one s life by hanging.  He then notes the the use of  apacgw  in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He presents that example of  apacgw  as being used to explicitly mean  suicide by hanging.  Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling  without the added denotation of  death   and as you insist that the Bible was written by God  and every word is precicely correct  you are stuck with the complete meaning of  apacgw  (ie: Since the word  apacgw  was used  then death is denoted as the result).   By the way  I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of  apacgw :  > In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus)  > it s only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 :  Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice  > was not followed  he saddled a donkey  and arose and went home to his house  > to his city. Then he put his household in order  and hanged himself  and  > died  and he was buried in his father s tomb.    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > ^^^^  > Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel  hanged himself  [Gr. Sept.  > APAGCHO]  but it explicitly adds   and died .  Here we have no doubt of the > result. > In Matthew  we are not explicitly told Judas died.  Note Mr DeCenso  as you say  the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to Greek  and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie  the the Hebrew say  and died )  and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek.  It should also be pointed out that  regardless of the added  and died   the correct translation would still be  apacgw   as the man did indeed die from strangulation (redundant  but correct).  Further  we have evidence that the Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions which contradicted each other)  and such editing was not even necessarily executed by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it now stands  as a paragon of ancient greek.  So  what you really need to prove your point Mr DeCenso  is an example  in ancient greek  of someone committing  apacgw  and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless assertions without corresponding evidence.   Now I would note Mr DeCenso  that everytime I go out of my way to research it one of your apparently contrived exegisis  I pretty much find it false.  Thus  I think that if you are going to add to the text  something over and above what the source clearly says  then you had better have an explicit Greek or historical source to justify it.   By the way  as to Mr Rose s statement about trees around the Potter s Field:  > There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.  Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old  or that there are 2000 year old stumps there  or has a 2 thousand year old description of the area which mentions such trees  then it is inappropriate for him to assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two thousand years ago (after all  things change).   Now as to your other argument  ie: that the money Judas used is not the same as the 30 silvers:  > As to your second question Mr DeCenso  you ask how we could be sure that the > money with which Judas purchased the land  was indeed for the betrayal  rather > than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts  where it specifically > mention  the reward of iniquity  [Acts 1:18]  it also specifically mentions > what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16  ...concerning > Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus. ).  Now I would point out > that when the Bible describes an act of  iniquity   and then immediately > discusses  *the* reward of iniquity   it would be rather inane to suggest that > it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.  >  >   > Notice that in verse 16  the word  iniquity  is not used.  Rather  it states > that Judas  became a guide to those who arrested Jesus . > But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17   for he was numbered with us and > obtained a part in this ministry.   What part did Judas play in their ministry? >          ^^^^^^  True  Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas  betrayal  an iniquity   but for that matter  neither does John specifically call Judas  actions  an iniquity  either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took the money box  but rather said:       Some thought that because  Judas had the money box  Jesus was telling      him  Buy what we need for the feast   or that he should give something      to the poor  So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out  and      it was night.   Note that it is said that Judas left  it does not say that he took the money box.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose the a an unproven iniquity  mentioned by another author  in a different book  written at a different time  over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived.   Of course this particular argument becomes moot  since we have have seen evidence that  apacgw  means suicide.  You see  since Judas  hanging was successful  he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29  because Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie: Passover)  and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself the next day.  Thus the money which bought the  Field of Blood  would have to have been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver that night as well  and thus couldn t have spent that either.  Oh dear  I believe that the house of cards is comming down).   Maybe we should at this point  discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.  By the way  as to where the prophesy of the Potter s field came from (ie: the mention of it in Matthew)  you say:  > Please  when we are done with this study on his death  remind me to discuss > this with you.  I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It s all part of the same verse we are discussing  and I wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping  these issues.

I would note again  that you are not stating that that Bible     is not possibly inerrant  you are stating that it *IS* inerrant.     Since you have been  by your own admission  presenting merely  possible      reconciliations (I of course don t rate them that highly)  then the      best you can do is say that the Bible is  possibly  inerrant  not that      it *is* inerrant."windows, > In article <1993Apr06.185638.12139@metrics.com> tomh@metrics.com (Tom Haapanen) writes: >  > >Has anyone used a Hercules Graphite adapter?

The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights  is a complete lie and deception  as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving.  Liberty is never free  it is always purchased at some cost   almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable? Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save another  or even a group of others  whos life is more inalienable?   That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty   especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable  the serial killer  or the victim?  According to that beautiful line  those two rights should be completely inviolate  that is  noone should be able to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people s life and/or liberty  but is not his own life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence  it is.  >>>Murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule.

Well  then answer me this:   you seem to be opposed to moral relativism (as you call it) because it has the capacity to degenerate.  Obviously  then  you would advocate a nonrelative (absolute) moral system.  Whose absolutist moral system do we choose?    How do we come to this decision?

Fine.  I can agree with most of what you typed here.  However  just because morality gets based on something nonrelative does NOT mean that we have to pick your xtianity as its base.  We can start a morality based on dignity of humans  freedom of choice  tolerance  etc. and NEVER EVER rely on xtianity for anything.  Just because someone has a consistent moral system based on true principles does not mean that they have to involve xtianity in it.  Xtianity certainly does not have a monopoly on principles of behavior  indeed  fewer religions are guiltier of violating their own principles     windows," >[...] Stuff del d for bandwidth s sake.  >Why?  *sigh*  If you don t have more than 16MBs of memory using a RAMDrive >with windows is a _waste_ of memory.

I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from others  but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject  I do not feel dishonest  though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in this example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research specifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not as tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means  and I still am not competent with it  but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich  Greek Lexicon  renders each verse in order  each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical order.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable  the syntax is far from clear.  On the other hand  a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes things a lot more comprehendable.  And yes  the word for field in Acts 1:18 is indeed  chorion.    Now I ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:  	 Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament   Louw and Nida 	 Robinson s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament  	 Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament   Grimm 	 Word study Concordance   Tynsdale 	 A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other  	 early Christian Writings   Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich 	 The New Analytical Greek Lexicon   Perschbacher  In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:  	A space  place  region  district  field  area   country place    	land  farm  estate   a bit of tillage   and similar meanings.  Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about  grave.  As some of these  books go into great detail  I would be very surprised to find that these books  are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I  think it more likely that Mr Archer s investigations into  contradictions  to  be once again  as your friend said it   lacking in substance   and thus Archer  is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso  I would  have honorably presented my results on this matter  even if I had found them to support Mr Archer s contentions).   By the way  among these lexicons  (eg: Robinson s) is the definition of  agros   the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word  agros  is defined as  a field in the country.  Chorion is specifically noted as a synonym to agros.  This is significant  as it is evidence of how silly Bullinger s exegisis was  which stated that the word for  field  in Matthew (ie: agros) is different from the word for  field  in Acts (ie: chorion)  and thus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already admit how stupid Bullinger s exegisis is  but this was a small serendipity which drives the point home).   So as of now  unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise (eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references)  I consider this  particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso  now you can go on to answer questions about the denials of Peter  the day of the Crucifixion  Tyre  and  the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in discussing the  Potter s Field.

Indeed  allow them freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one s wealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth.

Some folks call this agnosticism.  It does not suffer >from  blind faith  at all.  I think of it as  Don t worry  be happy .   For many atheists  the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods  nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?   There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word  on faith   we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past  we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else  why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?   The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing  rather than  as some agnostic posters would have it  whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods  even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times  for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism  unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence  why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?   I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn t require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don t believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found.   David Nye (nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu).

Why are only those people in favor of the system to blame.  If society accepts such a system  then each member of society is to blame when an innocent person gets executed.  Those that are not in favor should work to convince others.  And  most members of our society have accepted the blame--they ve considered the risk to be acceptable.  Similarly  every person who drives must accept the blame for fatal traffic accidents.  This is something that is surely going to happen when so many people are driving.  It is all a question of what risk is acceptable.  It is much more likely that an innocent person will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed.  keithatheism, >>implanted some sort of electronic device. >Why wait until they commit the crime?

Anyway  I think that  revenge  or  fairness  is why most people are in favor of the punishment.  If a murderer is going to be punished  people that think that he should  get what he deserves.

If someone wrongs me  I will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage is removed  or a similar situation is forced upon him.

That is to say  the religion of this country  and the non-religion of the USSR.  That was what most of those quotes were about  and some included all atheists  in general  as well.  I don t think that any of the quotes (although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus. They advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not mentioned.  >>You have missed this point.  I said that the motto didn t say anything >>about anyone in particular.

Based on the facts that christianity says all >other religions are wrong  and because it seems that the motto was >written by christians  I doubt your claim.  So  you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions should be outlawed  just because they think they are wrong?  That s silly.

My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to   kill people.  That is it s primary (and I would argue only)   purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has   almost no utility  especially when you know you will be killing   innocents  is unconscionable.    At the very least  the existence of the prison system and our   transportation system are based on their merits to society  not   their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent   lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued   existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and   the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.    Just in case I wasn t clear again:  We maintain a capital   punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with   no net positive gain.  Why?

The scenario you outline is reasonably  consistent  but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does not support it  but indicates something far different. The Earth  by latest estimates  is about 4.6 billion years old  and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at most) about 200 000 years. But  the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving  and  in fact  disease-ridden  long before there were people. (Yes  there are fossils that show signs of disease... mostly bone disorders  of course  but there are some.) Heck  not just fossil evidence  but what we ve been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long  long time. If human sin was what brought about disease (at least  indirectly  though necessarily) then how could it exist before humans?  >                             God created the original genetic code >perfect and without flaw.

Although the forces of >natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species  the >degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.     Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists  who know more about biology than you claim to  who will strongly disagree with this. There is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other)  started off  in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment  in a collective sense. I m really curious as to what you mean by  the degeneration of the genetic code .  >Human DNA  being more  complex   tends to accumulate errors adversely >affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease  while the  >simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in  >causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.   Umm. Nah  we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria  and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size  but the ranks keep changing. For example  bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease  I m sure you ll agree. But it still pops up from time to time  even today... and doesn t do as much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation  but even when people get the disease  the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago  and because the really nasty variants  overgrazed   (forgive the poor terminology  I m an engineer  not a doctor! :-> ) and died off for lack of nearby hosts.

Now  wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect  right? And  you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It seems unlikely that Satan  who s making the diseases  would also gift humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less lethal  if he wants survivors. As far as I can see  our immune systems  imperfect though they may (presently?) be  must have been built into us by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not  at the time of design  necessary? That is  God made our immune systems ahead of time  knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases?  >This may be more of a mystical/supernatural explanation than you >are prepared to accept  but God is not responsible for disease. >Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of >disease  evolution by random chance would have produced them since >humanity forsook God s protection.   Here s another puzzle. What  exactly  do you mean by  perfect  in the phrase   created... perfect and without flaw ? To my mind  a  perfect  system would be incapable of degrading over time. A  perfect  system that will  without constant intervention  become imperfect is *not* a perfect system. At least  IMHO.  Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer s glue? That is  the original genetic  instructions  were perfect  but were  written  in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart? If so  why could God not have used better materials?  Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself  of did It just choose not to?

In the Jewish tradition you are incredibly wrong!  They originate in the Torah and with Jewish ancestors  specifically the Patriarch Abraham (z l).  That knowledge was sent East to India and China when Abraham gave  gifts  (the commentators to Jewish scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts) to all the rest of his children when he sent them away to the East.  This assured that Isaac only  who remained with Abraham  would inherit his most important spiritual gifts  what eventually became Judaism.  So you see  other religions can have very parochial views too.  By the Jewish view  you are very mistaken  your scripture are not scripture  your gods are not gods  your practices a jumble of errors that lead people to idol worship and away from God.  That doesn t stop us from respecting you to the extent of not trying to convert you or proselytize you and being willing to dialog in a respectful manner.

Their  nets  implies a fishing >village.  This is exactly what it has become -- a far cry from >its original position of stature .  Looking at [1] we find that during Roman times  Tyre vied with Sidon for first place in the intellectual life of the period   that Tyre was the seat of a Christian bishop  eventually with 14 dioceses under it  that  the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia  was the basilica built in Tyre ca. 314  that Tyre was well known for its exports of glassware  wine  white marble  and dyed cloth  that Tyre  along with other seaports   provided outlets for South Arabian  Indian and even Chinese trade   that Tyre had to accomodate its growing population by  following a perpendicular  rather than horizontal  line of growth  (because it was running out of land to build on)  that Tyre established colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a  small fishing village  by any stretch of the imagination.  Centuries later  under the Abbasids  Tyre had  opulent and flourishing bazaars  and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period  Tyre was  noted for its export of sugar  beads  and  as of old  glassware.  During the Crusades  Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held by Franks.  (There is a lot more  but I got tired of writing.)  In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon:  other *major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli  Sidon  Tyre  Baalbek and Zahlah.   [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of the Lebanese Civil War  and the Israeli military actions (1978  1982) on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel s withdrawel in 1984   Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local economy.   If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present  why is it always called a city (or  above  a  major city )?  Why does it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities in Lebanon are given  why is Tyre always one of the cities on the list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?  [1] Philip K. Hitti  _Lebanon in History: From the earliest times to the present_  NY  St. Martins  1967.    [2] Federal Research Division  Library of Congress  _Lebanon: a country study_  edited by Thomas Collelo  1989.  >>In the early 1980 s Tyre had over 22 000 people. > >So far I ve seen stated figurers ranging from 15 000 to 22 000. >Let s assume the latter one is correct.  By modern standards >we are talking about a one-horse town.  A one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse. (Anyway  Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They may even use cars these days. :-)   The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says  Pop. (1982 est.) 23 000.    Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range. (One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60 000  the same source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut  also  so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for the cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don t doubt that the population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In particular  the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.     >> After Alex the G it fell once more in the 1200 s  I believe.  What >>other times did it fall that you were thinking of?  > >To Egypt (250 bce)  to the Seleucids (198 bce)  Rome (63 bce)  after >Rome it fell to various Arab contingents until 1124 ce when it was >captured in the Crusades   it was then recaptured again by the Muslims >in 1291 ce and subsequently pillaged  then the French  Turks  British  >and today  Lebanon.  I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed. Don t most  if not all  of these apply not just to Tyre but to  the other cities in the area?  Sidon  for example?  Can you make a case for Tyre having been singled out?  >>Well  it recovered enough to have a thriving commerce in the dye >> Tyrian purple  in Roman times.  > >This is correct  but they were under Roman domination  and the  >majority of the created wealth was siphoned off.  The prophesy >hold true.  They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]: Tyre  receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes and from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a large series of coins  occasionally in gold ...   The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don t seem to fit your characterization  either.  And under the Abbasids it seems to have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small fishing village.  >Who is Josh McDowell.  A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low. He happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian  _Tyre through the Ages_  Beirut  Dar El-Mashreq Publishers  1969). The same sentence  in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of the prophecy using the same argument you are using  an argument that I haven t seen in print anywhere else  which is why I jumped to the conclusion that you were quoting Josh.  (I tried to find the Jidejian book  but it isn t listed in Books in Print.  Can you tell me more about it? Her descriptions are so much at odds with everything else I ve read  I m curious to know why.)  djreligion, >you give your allegiance.  That is why  even in this sinful state  when we >perform an evil act while we are submitted to God He does not place that >sinful act to our account (Rom 4:8) In the same vein you can perform all  >the good deeds in the book  if your life is not under God s control you are  >still sinning (see Rom 14:23).

It s truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country.  The Branch Dividians may have been nutty (my general opinion of all religious people)  but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds for destroying a people.  The killing of the four BATF agents was surey a dispicable act  but that was an escalation of the confrontation which the BATF started.  War is bad precisely because of humanity s tendancy for escalation.  That principle applies to all cases of warfare- whether it s between nuclear superpowers  feuding families or fledgling religious groups and our federal govt.  Why was warfare chosen as the course of action when patience and subtlety would also have worked?  Why is the petty letter of the law more important than peoples  lives and religious beliefs?  Perhaps the supposed professionals in our federal law inforcement agencies are just plain stupid.  It was interesting to watch the 700 club today.  Pat Robertson said that the  Branch Dividians had met the firey end for worshipping their false god.  He also said that this was a terrible tragedy and that the FBI really blew it.  However  I still feel that he s forgetting that every major religion in the world had a similarly humble  cult-status  beginning- even  and perhaps especially  christianity.  It is perhaps worthwhile to consider that the Branch Dividians  apocalyptic prophecies have been fulfilled.  Maybe David Koresh really was Jesus Christ (sure sounds like a neat opening epic for a new major religion to me). --  /*  jhallen@world.std.com (192.74.137.5) */               /* Joseph H.

Sorry if I seem skeptical put the price for the Office Package--$439.39 on the street--sounds like a great deal for the office that is purchasing its first computer and software.  But all four complete programs for less than $450 makes me just a little suspicious.  Maybe its just me.

Not because of what was actually shown (cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants to portray)  rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and how many naive people are actually believing the garbage found within it.  The truth is that neither you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay  but knowing as many as I do and knowing their testimonies and witnessing thier faith and life I have to say that the report you posted is a very biased report  something obviously claimed against gays as well.  The truth is that unless YOU are innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing.  I speak as an abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society.  I do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated by Christian Fundamentalist extremists  but I know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them to be.  It is no mistake that the APA removed homosexuality from it s list of mental illnesses  it is also no mistake that there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list. I do not feel threatened by gays  I don t understand why others are.  The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min- istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.  THE FOUNDER OF AN  EX-GAY  SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO  by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)  In December 1985  David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate s homophobia rewaa awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE INDEED  a national ex-gay ministry  Caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays and lesbians  a way out of the homosexual death-style  through prayer.   I d like to give the award back   Caligiuri now laughs   I m no longer deserve it.    Caligiuri s eight year involvement with the national  ex-gay  movement peaked with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex- gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.   There s no reality in it   he says   I was selling a product  and my product was a lie.    Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage  the organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their sexual urges and embracing Christianity.   We offer support to people who are seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality   explains Bob Davies  director of Exodus.  He ventures that  about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo- sexuality are men.     Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting their time   says Lisa Seeley  a former  redeemed lesbian  who worked with Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.   These organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.     It s possible to change your identity or your behavior   says sex educator Brian McNaught  author of _On Being Gay_.  But it s really impossible to change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay  but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.    Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both their romance and their business partnership  Caligiuri was sexually assaulted by a man he picked up in a bar.   I was really drunk   he recalls   and I went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all night  and the next morning he raped me again.    When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker  he returned home to the home he shared with his ex-lover.   He had another man there with him   Caligiuri recalls.   I thought at this time   If this is what being gay is about  I don t want to be this way anymore.    Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out  he would share his discovery with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix s gay pride parade in June 1985  and a few months later Free Indeed held its first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance  Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays  telling them ther were sinners headed for hell.   Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week  thanks in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.   We were listed under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services   Caligiuri says   so people thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out where the local bars were  and we d preach to them about the sins of homo- sexuality.   Ruses like this are typical of the movement  Caligiuri says  adding   They ll do anything to reach these people.     David used to go on radio and say really stupid things   recalls Peter Kelly  a counselor at Phoenix s Catholic diocese AIDS program   like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.    Caligiuri s family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on Raphael s syndicated talk show in 1985.   They were relieved   he recalls.  They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family  better that I should be a  reformed  gay person.    But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.   By the time I appeared on Sally s show    I d started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor  sex with their father.  I was horny all the time.    Unable to risk going to gay bars  where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances  Caligiuri says he  used to go to bookstores and get blowjobs.   When he wasn t working the bookstores  he was sleeping with other  reformed  homosexuals.    I didn t realize it at first  but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex with one another   Caligiuri says.   We d go to conferences in other cities  and we d be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody else.    By the time he appeared on  AM Philadelphia  television show in May 1988  Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show s host asked him if he ever  acted on temptation   his answer was a lie.   Caligiuri s duplicity began to take it s toll on him  however.  He was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis  a dibilitating yeast infection  and this led to his escape from the sect.   I was too sick to go to church   he explains.   The more time I spent away from those people the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.    Late in 1991  Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local church and closed the ministry s doors.   I d convinced myself that there is no need in the world for ex-gay people   he says.   Today  Caligiuri  31  is studying alternative spiritualities ( I m interest- ed in belief systems that aren t judgemental. )  considering romance ( But not with a CHristian! )  and searching for a new project to devote himself to.  I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes   he says.   I want to eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I may have brought to our community.   ---end article---  Caligiuri s tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles of former leaders and founders of  ex-gay  ministries who have said very similar th similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity  but have come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some  like Chris Glaser  director of the Presbyterian  Lazarus Project  of West Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also  as I said talked and become and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as  Love In Action  and others  who either once claimed to have been  reformed  or who were too honest with themselves to live a lie  no matter who was disappointed in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of  sealing  their new heterosexuality  only to eventually start hitting the bars  bathhouses and bookstores  since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous  sin  through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people  and the very inno- cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also mrtifying  is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on them  they may even opt for  suicide  or surgical dampering of the brain functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common- place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the threat of coercive Christianity toward gays  such as Sylvia Pennington s _ Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as Maury Johnston s _Gays Under Grace_  and Chris Glaser s _Come Hom!_.  I seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and self-acceptance.  Thank you.religion, health insurance programs offer coverage for abortion.

I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of conscience.  It disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums may be being used to pay for that which I sincerely believe is murder.  I would like to request that I be exempted from abortion coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly.                                Sincerely     My policy number is:     ---------------------------------------------------------------- To your state and national representatives:      RE: Abortion and health coverage  Dear    It has recently come to my attention as a result of the current abortion debate that my health insurance coverage provided by my employer may include coverage paying for abortions.    I strongly oppose abortion for reasons of conscience and am disturbed greatly that my coverage may be being used in this manner.  However  I depend on my employers  provided health coverage  and fear that if I speak up about it  that I may lose not only my coverage but even my job.  I would like to ask you to put into law the provision that health insurance providers make abortion coverage non-compulsory in their health insurance program  so that it can be declined  with an appropriate reduction in premium.  In order that there be no difference in the dollar ammount in the health benefit packages between those who would choose to have abortion coverage and those who would not  I further ask that you include a provision in which the reduction in premium resulting from the declining of  abortion coverage  be paid-out to the employee  rather than pocketed by the employer.    This second provision should serve to dissuade employers from pressuring employees into taking one or the other stand with regard to abortion services.  Thank you very much.

I know  that R.E.P. is a student at University of Delaware  I have his e-mail address  his US postal address and his (?) phone . The question is: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED?

Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues  you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions  some relevant books are listed in a companion article.  To provide a sense of cohesion and progression  I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.  Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked  and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism.  So when I talk of religion  I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity  Judaism and Islam  which involve some sort of superhuman divine being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions  but some of it may not.   What is atheism?   Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. Some atheists go further  and believe that God does not exist.  The former is often referred to as the  weak atheist  position  and the latter as  strong atheism .  It is important to note the difference between these two positions.   Weak atheism  is simple scepticism  disbelief in the existence of God.   Strong atheism  is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are  strong atheists .  Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods  others limit their atheism to specific Gods  such as the Christian God  rather than making flat-out denials.   But isn t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn t exist?   Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false  one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.   What is agnosticism then?   The term  agnosticism  was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed ( strong ) atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable.  Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists.  Words are slippery things  and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that you can work out someone s philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example  many people use agnosticism to mean  weak atheism   and use the word  atheism  only when referring to  strong atheism .  Beware also that because the word  atheist  has so many shades of meaning  it is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for sure is that atheists don t believe in God.  For example  it certainly isn t the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe.   So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?   There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist  it s best to ask her.  Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self-contradictory  and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism  because they see no evidence that God exists.   But isn t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?   There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example  it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers.  Of course  this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly well-defined is a matter for debate.  However  assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible  there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of God.  If we assume that something does not exist  it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.  If on the other hand we assume that something does exist  and if the thing in question is not provably impossible  showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found  to show that it isn t there.  Such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest primes  because we can prove that they don t exist.  Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of the time  they don t believe in unicorns  even though they can t conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.  To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he doesn t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God does not exist  since that is an assumption we can test.  Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists  instead  they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists  it may be possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present-day religion exists.  In practice  believing that no God described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no God exists.  However  it is sufficiently different that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of God are not really applicable.   But what if God is essentially non-detectable?   If God interacts with our universe in any way  the effects of his interaction must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable.  If God is essentially non-detectable  it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue that if God does not interact with our universe at all  it is of no importance whether he exists or not.  If the Bible is to be believed  God was easily detectable by the Israelites. Surely he should still be detectable today?  Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically verifiable  physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence  though  otherwise  how can I distinguish him from all the other things that don t exist?   OK  you may think there s a philosophical justification for atheism  but  isn t it still a religious belief?   One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is  the redefinition game .  The cynical view of this game is as follows:  Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out that it can t be true  person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He then records the statement  along with the fact that person B has agreed to it  and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an  agreed fact   but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent  B will tend to play along.  The point of this digression is that the answer to the question  Isn t atheism a religious belief?  depends crucially upon what is meant by  religious .   Religion  is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship.  [ It s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not    religion  according to such a definition. ]  Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power  nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of  religious  to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as  religious  as well -- such as science  politics  and watching TV.   OK  so it s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is  still just an act of faith  like religion is?   Firstly  it s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in.  Secondly  it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible  and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt.  Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example  it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called  acts of faith   then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith  and the term loses its meaning.  Faith is more often used to refer to complete  certain belief in something. According to such a definition  atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith.  Of course  individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is  certain .  This is not a general tendency  however  there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists.  Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof. Sceptical atheism certainly doesn t fit that definition  as sceptical atheism has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer  but still doesn t really match  as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.   If atheism is not religious  surely it s anti-religious?   It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either  for  or  against    friend  or  enemy .  The truth is not so clear-cut.  Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism  in that sense  it can be said to be  anti-religion .  However  when religious believers speak of atheists being  anti-religious  they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.  This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair. Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.  Most atheists take a  live and let live  attitude.  Unless questioned  they will not usually mention their atheism  except perhaps to close friends.  Of course  this may be in part because atheism is not  socially acceptable  in many countries.  A few atheists are quite anti-religious  and may even try to  convert  others when possible.  Historically  such anti-religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.  (To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state  just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished.  The institution of  state atheism  came about when Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population.)  Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs  but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example  the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate.   But if you don t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state   surely that s the same as state atheism?   The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular  it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another  but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature.  Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For example  religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms.  Even today  many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters  and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds  most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say.   What about prayer in schools? If there s no God  why do you care if people  pray?   Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers  and tend to do things that those who don t pray can t just ignore.  Also  Christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non-Christians  even if they are told that they need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event.  Also  non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time  even without other motives.   You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about  atheists?  Why aren t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don t  atheists object to the religious charities?   There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well  for the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis.  Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn t worth shouting about in connection with charity.  To them  atheism is just a simple  obvious everyday matter  and so is charity.  Many feel that it s somewhat cheap  not to say self-righteous  to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs.  To  weak  atheists  building a hospital to say  I do not believe in God  is a rather strange idea  it s rather like holding a party to say  Today is not my birthday .  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.   You said atheism isn t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against  one s upbringing  a way of rebelling?   Perhaps it is  for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them  and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists.  It s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing  as a way of being different.  On the other hand  many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others.  On the whole  we can t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism  although in general  people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently.   How do atheists differ from religious people?   They don t believe in God.  That s all there is to it.  Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards  even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem  even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts  they may dress all in black  they may even wear orange robes.  (Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for arguing against  of course!  Whoever you are  the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance.   Unexceptional? But aren t atheists less moral than religious people?  That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God  then of course atheists are less moral as they don t obey any God.  But usually when one talks of morality  one talks of what is acceptable ( right ) and unacceptable ( wrong ) behaviour within society.  Humans are social animals  and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from  anti-social  or  immoral  behaviour  purely for the purposes of self-preservation.  Many atheists behave in a  moral  or  compassionate  way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care what happens to others?  They don t know  they simply are that way.  Naturally  there are some people who behave  immorally  and try to use atheism to justify their actions.  However  there are equally many people who behave  immorally  and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions.  For example:     Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ    came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason  I was    shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited    patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive    eternal life.  Now to the king eternal  immortal  invisible  the only God     be honor and glory forever and ever.   The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer  the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee  Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer  there is a religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?     A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior    deteriorated after  born again  experiences.  While only 4% of respondents    said they had driven intoxicated before being  born again   12% had done    so after conversion.  Similarly  5% had used illegal drugs before    conversion  9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex    before salvation  5% after.                                 [ Freethought Today   September 1991  p. 12.]  So it seems that at best  religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour.   Is there such a thing as atheist morality?   If you mean  Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?   then the answer is yes  as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.  If you mean  Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?   then the answer is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same  moral rules  as theists  but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by humans  according to the way humans feel the world  ought  to work  rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.   Then aren t atheists just theists who are denying God?   A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them.  Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial  they are unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions  sometimes in very great depth.  They have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.  This decision may  of course  be an inevitable consequence of that individual s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person  the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense  and hence the only choice that person can honestly make.   But don t atheists want to believe in God?   Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many of them have no desire to be watched over  no matter how good-natured the  Big Brother  figure might be.  Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough  there must be evidence for the belief.   But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are  unwilling in their souls to see!   Many  if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained above  the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.  Of course  it is true that some atheists lack an open mind  but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded. Comments such as  Of course God is there  you just aren t looking properly  are likely to be viewed as patronizing.  Certainly  if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth  debate is futile.   Isn t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?   Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives meaning to life  and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives count  not by wishing for eternal life  but by having an influence on other people who will live on.  For example  an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform  in the hope of leaving his mark on history.  It is a natural human tendency to look for  meaning  or  purpose  in random events.  However  it is by no means obvious that  life  is the sort of thing that has a  meaning .  To put it another way  not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking  What is the meaning of life?  is as silly as asking  What is the meaning of a cup of coffee? .  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning  it just is.   So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?   There are many ways of obtaining comfort  from family  friends  or even pets. Or on a less spiritual level  from food or drink or TV.  That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger  but so what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting  or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?  In the end  it s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort  and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy  that s just hard luck.   Don t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?   The short answer is  No  do you?   Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God  but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.  Thousands of years of religious belief haven t resulted in any good proof of the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future  and they stop worrying about it.   So why should theists question their beliefs? Don t the same arguments  apply?   No  because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is the sceptical  default position  to take  it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.  Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers  but to everyone else.   What sort of harm?   Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It s not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings  think of all the time and effort spent building churches  praying  and so on. Imagine how that effort could be better spent.  Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances of ill people being  healed  by a priest  ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors  and dying as a result.  Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.  It is arguable that the Catholic Church s opposition to birth control -- and condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.  Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion.   Those weren t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some  sort of excuse.   What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it s hard to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups  all convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who s a REAL Christian and who isn t  when even the major Christian churches like the Catholic Church and the Church of England can t decide amongst themselves?  In the end  most atheists take a pragmatic view  and decide that anyone who calls himself a Christian  and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his actions  should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can t be much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God  why couldn t he have made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs aren t a perversion of what your God intended?  If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible  then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so? Sorry  but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so  we must call him a Christian.   Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since  nobody has ever proved that God does not exist  it must be very unlikely  that more basic religious beliefs  shared by all faiths  are nonsense.   That does not hold  because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue  positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns don t exist  but that doesn t make it unlikely that they are myths.  It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course   weak  atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still.   Well  if atheism s so great  why are there so many theists?   Unfortunately  the popularity of a belief has little to do with how  correct  it is  or whether it  works   consider how many people believe in astrology  graphology  and other pseudo-sciences.  Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies  religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.  Of course  there s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world  we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world  but nowadays it serves other purposes as well.   But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say  something?   Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar  for example  it s worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense.  Of course  most religions are quick to denounce competing religions  so it s rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.   What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded  that God exists?   For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god  there is one who does not.  Besides  as has already been pointed out  the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it.  Also  it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders.  A famous scientist is only human  she may be an expert in some fields  but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.   So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates  nothing?   Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far.  The theory of memetics talks of  memes  -- sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds  by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes  which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine  or by using peer pressure to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes.  Of course  in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it  any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it.   Even if religion is not entirely true  at least it puts across important  messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?   There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a few of them  don t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions.     There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.     Be especially sceptical of positive claims.     If you want your life to have some sort of meaning  it s up to you to    find it.     Search for what is true  even if it makes you uncomfortable.     Make the most of your life  as it s probably the only one you ll have.     It s no good relying on some external power to change you  you must change    yourself.     Just because something s popular doesn t mean it s good.     If you must assume something  assume something it s easy to test.     Don t believe things just because you want them to be true.  and finally (and most importantly):     All beliefs should be open to question.

CRITZ  III  <71611.365@CompuServe.COM> Subject: EnviroLeague   Birth Announcement  on March 7  1993  from EARTH Forum  CompuServe                        Information Service ===================================================================                        FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT                      -------------------                                        (SM)                         EnviroLeague   A new youth movement  EnviroLeague   was recently born  according to its founder  Boyd R. Critz  III (CIS ID  71611 365)  of Peoria  Illinois. EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth  both male and female  in matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our environment.   Incorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation  its Articles and initial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to Critz  its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and Objectives:                              MISSION      It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members    to foster and implement the improved education of young    people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards    of The Earth  to leave The Earth in a better condition    than they found it  and to otherwise act as responsible     moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue    the accomplishment of this Mission  EnviroLeague shall    seek to serve as a catalyst  focusing in common cause the    separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation     improvement  and responsible use of the environment in    which we must all live.                            OBJECTIVES      In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague  its primary    objectives shall be:        (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many             environmentally concerned organizations as             possible  said Movement having as its primary             focus the education and participatory             involvement of young people in appropriate areas             of environmental concern         (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and             their branches a full complement of program             materials for their use  including suitable             uniforms  insignia and other badges  written             ideas  syllabi and information  literature and             other items as shall seem appropriate and             desirable         (3)  To serve as a  clearing house  for the exchange             of program ideas  materials and information             among said organizations   and        (4)  To assist environmentally concerned             organizations to recruit and train the necessary             adult leadership for their youth programs.   EnviroLeague will operate through three  Program Divisions  serving youth in the elementary  middle and high school grades  respectively.  Service shall be through formation of  EnviroLeague Teams   either by EnviroLeague itself or by environmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a charter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.   EnviroLeague  as it develops  will be controlled by the actual adult leaders of each local Team  and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper conduct. Organizations accepting a charter may  however  impose certain additional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such organizations do so  EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming  as soon as possible  new nearby Teams having no such restrictions  particularly as to youth membership.   EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to contribute to developing its programs.  Thus  the top youth leaders of its Teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any local administrative groups  and those for its high school youth may be involved in similar functions at the national level.   Program materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the  draft  portions of the Mentor s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the EARTH Forum  Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes place.   CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague s founder chose this electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation. This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH Forums.   The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe s Earth Forum - GO EARTH - message and library areas 17  both named  EnviroLeague.  ============================================================================   Subsequently  EnviroLeague s Initial Governance Council has held its first meeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian (equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home (309) 675-4483 in case of real need.

You must be using  values  to mean something different from the way I see it used normally.  And you are certainly using  Science  like that if you equate it to  the real world .  Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning those perceptions.  It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see. Values are ... well they are what I value. They are what I would have rather than not have - what I would experience rather than not  and so on.  Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are applicable to everyone.  >If there is no such thing as objective value  then science can not  >objectively be said to be more useful than a kick in the head.  I don t agree. Science is useful insofar as it the predictions mentioned above are accurate.  That is insofar as what I think *will be* the effect on my perceptions of a time lapse (with or without my input to the Universe) versus what my perceptions actually turn out to be.  But values are about whether I like (in the loosest sense of the word) the  perceptions :-)  >Simple theories with accurate predictions could not objectively be said >to be more useful than a set of tarot cards.    I don t see why.  Usefulness  in science is synonomous with  accuracy  - period. Tarot predictions are not useful because they are not accurate - or can t be shown to be accurate. Science is useful because it is apparently accurate.  Values - objective or otherwise - are beside the point.  No?  tommyreligion, The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man s rebellion against God  which is described so vividly in the pages of the Scriptures.  Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the Eastern Orthodox Church  this is called  theosis   or  deification.   One can also say that man was created to be whole  i.e. spirit  soul  and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs was a harmonious relationship with each other  the world  and the Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God  their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly irreconcilable halves. Immediately  guilt and fear was manifested in their lives. They become bound to hardship  toil  and suffering.  This is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.  The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it were to receive this self-awareness  the knowledge of good and evil  its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.  Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining of self-awareness carefully staged by God  who did not desire that His masterpiece  mankind  be a blissful idiot?  God must have known that  for mankind to achieve any kind of moral value  he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There is no other way to achieve union with God.  Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities. He was the perfectly integrated individual  reconciling the opposites  and making it possible for us to be integrated  i.e. to become God  not in His essence  but in His energies.  The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the answer to his dilemma in vs 25.                                   Mark windows, then tell us what the REAL world results are?

Michael Busse and Gary Cooper  cofounders of Exodus International and lovers for 13 years  were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The program was described by these men as  ineffective . . . not one person was healed.   They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees  many were driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed  reparative therapy.   The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE  June 30  1992 called  The Ex-Ex-Gay  by Robert Pela.  Some personal thoughts:  It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among its ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition  only all they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then  to save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even later  the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery  oppression and segragation of African-Americans  even to the justification of lynchings. Today s scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is still coersion  but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind control  convincing people that they should see themselves as less than God sees them  then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt thier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure  no one is  physically  forced to stay in this  reparative therapy  but sheer social pressure is enough for many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.  As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution against gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by the contibution  or non-contribution to the society in which they live  not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven  t a clue what is in their heart.  For those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them please contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians And Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of people comprised of Gays  Lesbians and Bisexuals  their parents and friends who have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some  first-hand  real life and loving understanding.  God s love and understanding for Gay people is no less abundant.  Thank you. PAXatheism, There are definitely quite a few horrible deaths as the result of both atheists AND theists.  I m sure Bobby can list quite a few for the atheist side but fails to recognize that the theists are equally proficient at genocide.  Perhaps  since I m a bit weak on history  somone here would like to give a list of wars caused/led by theists?  I can think of a few (Hitler claimed to be a Christian for example) but a more complete list would probably be more effective in showing Bobby just how absurd his statement is.  > Peace   On a side note  I notice you always sign your posts  Peace .

Assuming  for the moment  that morals _are_ relative  then two relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that produces the desired results.  Assuming that there is an absolute morality  two disagreeing  objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right  there is no room for compromise.  Once you beleive in absolute morals  you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees with you is amoral.

All types of software may be submitted for entry in WSM - utilities  applications  games  programming tools  etc.  WSM benefits Windows shareware/freeware authors by allowing them to publicize their software releases  inform users of updated versions  and to increase their installed base of users.  Those searching for specific Windows software will benefit by having a complete list of available software available at their fingertips - complete with feature lists  current prices  and any other relevant information.  Windows software authors may submit entries to Windows Shareware Monthly in the following manner:  1. Compose a short summary of the function of the software.  Include all    special features which are unique to your product and which set it apart    from other programs in the genre.  Be sure to include specific details    such as: the current release version  where the software is available     how much the registration fee costs  how much disk space is required  any    special requirements (e.g. sound card  or VBRUN200.DLL  etc.)  how the    author may be contacted  etc.  Because text is highly compressible  the    summary may be as long as is necessary  however  it is best to keep it    short.  A good guideline is a single screenful of 12-point text at 640x480    resolution.  Order forms and other such addendum may be included if desired.    All submissions whould be in plain text (ASCII) format.  Formatting will    be exactly as it is submitted - I will simply cut and paste text files    into a Help Authoring system.  If you require special formatting     conventions - such as boldface text or italics  or a larger font size     indicate so CLEARLY within the text file.  For best results  use Windows    NotePad to create the .TXT file.    2. Include up to 100k of Windows-format .BMP (bitmap) screen-shots which    display the workings or special features of each program.  Special cases    (rendering applications for example) which require 256-color bitmaps may    submit up to 250k of .BMP files - all other should observe the 100k limit    and use 16-color format.  For maximum compatiblity with the software which    will be used to create the WSM .HLP file (Stefan Olson s Help Writer s    Assistant for Windows)  please save the bitmaps with Windows Paintbrush or    WinGIF.   3. Include a 16-color .BMP of the program s icon (.ICO file).  Many programs    are available to convert .ICO to .BMP format  or Windows Paintbrush may be    used.  The .BMP will be embedded in the summary text.  4. Double-check for spelling errors  formatting corrections  etc.    5. Compress the .TXT file  the .BMP of the program icon  and any additional    .BMPs into a single file using PKZIP (any version).  6. Submit the entry by UUENCODING the .ZIPfile  and e-mailing it to:        DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU     if submitting via the Internet or Compuserve. If submitting via America    Online  send a brief message indicating submission  and append the .ZIP    file  then e-mail to:     DiegoAA  7. If any changes are required  or a new version is released  complete    the above procedures again.  Send all submissions to the @TAMUTS address     and any comments  suggestions  criticisms  to DAA7365@RIGEL.TAMU.EDU.  All entries received before the deadline will be included in the subsequent edition of WSM.  The editor will not be held responsible for any errors  and we reserve the right to make changes to the entries.  WSM is not limited to shareware/freeware software.  A special area will be devoted to commercially available Windows 3.x and NT software.  Commercial software authors should follow the same steps above  with the exception of the limitations on size - the .TXT file and .BMPs may be as large as required (and as large as is practical for transmission over phone lines).  There is no charge for the publishing of either shareware/freeware or commercial product entries.    Advertisements for computer hardware  software  bulletin boards  etc. may be submitted as well. Again  the same procedures apply  with the exception of the size limitations.  There is no charge for advertising space.  The first ten advertisements submitted each month will be included  subsequent submissions will not be included due to size constraints.  WSM is currently looking for persons willing to devote the time to author columns within WSM.  A C/C++ programing section  a Visual Basic section  and two Windows-specific opinion/advice columns are envisioned.  All work will be on a voluntary basis.  If you wish to aid WSM and author a monthly column on one of the above topics  please send us mail at DAA7365@TAMUTS.TAMU.EDU or DiegoAA on America Online.   The first edition of WSM will be distributed May 1st via America Online  Compuserve  and the Internet.  The deadline for submissions is April 28th. The first edition filename will be WSM-1.ZIP  with each subsequent monthly release continuing in the series naming convention (WSM-2.ZIP  etc.).  Each edition will be released on the first of each month  and the deadline for submission will be at least three days before release.    windows," Yes  both dblspaced and non-dblspaced drives can be defragmented.
